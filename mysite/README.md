## Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file for sensitive credentials. **Never commit this file to GitHub.**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Django
SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
DEBUG=True

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Where to get each value

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Generate one at [djecrety.ir](https://djecrety.ir) or run `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"` |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) → Developers → API Keys |

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **Render**. Key production setup:

- `DEBUG=False` in environment variables
- Gunicorn as the WSGI server (`gunicorn mysite.wsgi`)
- WhiteNoise for static file serving
- Cloudinary for all media file storage (required since Render's filesystem is ephemeral)
- All `.env` variables added manually in Render's Environment tab
